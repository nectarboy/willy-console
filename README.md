### `What is Willy Console ?`
```
Willy Console is my own imaginary console, with custom specs, instructions, and more :D
It's kinda inspired by the GameBoy but it has my touch as well uwu
```

### `Is it gonna be a real console ?`
```Fuck naw. But when I'm done making the specs im gonna make an emulator for it !```

### `What are the specs ?`
```Check the `WC_TEK.txt` file for a complete technical reference, and `WC_INS.txt` for the complete instruction set + and opcode encoding.```

### `And how the hell will you make ROMS for it may I ask ?`
```Ima make my own Willy Console Assembler uwu```

`Welp, das Willy Console. Buhbye !`
